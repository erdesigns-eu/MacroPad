The macropad designer is a application to help you design your own Macro Keyboard, and create a template you can use with the ERDKeyboardLayout component and/or the MacroPadFile.
You can add/remove keys, add a icon or legend (caption), and give the keys there unique colors. You can also directly assign the KeyCode, there is a "Listen" button that will capture the corresponding key press.
